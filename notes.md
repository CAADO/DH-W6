the plan: 

We're going to extract the data of livingston's writings from the livingston archive, do a word analysis of it, put it into excel and then present it as a poster.
The goal is to look in particular for livingston's use of ideas like 'rights' in his explinations for the world around him. Does he apply the idea of rights in his everyday life or writing? what about to specific groups? how does livingston connect to rights.\

so the first challenge is figuring out what to even download. after some looking, I think what I want is the TEI transcriptions, all that are available. 

the additional challenge: I can't use R. I was hoping that by delaying this, I would get access to my computer that isn't throwing a tantrum everytime R boots, but I can't wait any longer. 

my attempted pull grabbed a whole bunch of them, so let's take a look. The first thing I want to do is see if I can plug the XML files right into Voyant. 

that actually worked way better then I was expecting. 

the results are quite fascinating: livingston does use the term rights, in the context of political rights, using phrases like 'rights tenderly cared for' infrequently, but in his 1.8 million words and almost 2000 messages about slaves, he never once mentions rights. 

Voyant was a really good tool for this data, in my opinion. Next, the question is how do I graph it. 

I'm going to try to use excel for this, using the import data function to import to whole folder. I don't think this will work, but I think it's worth trying. 

so rather then any data, it instead gave me a spreadsheet of all my XML files. This isn't what I wanted, but could be useful. 

considering how well Voyant worked, I'm going to try out AntConc

It can't process xml files, should have seen that one comming. 

next attempt: topic modeling, using the tool. 

this was also a failure, totally incompehensable data. Apperently it didn't feel like playing nice with the XML files this time. I'm pretty sure it grabbed the titles, but I will upload the lot of the failures so you can take a look if you want. 

So I have some excelent Voyant results, a API call that worked, and several attempts at visualisations that failed. I think I'm going to make a hard turn, and instead I'm going to make an audio file about this. That's what I spent time on before, and I think it's the most interesting way to explain what I'm thinking in this case. It was also a big focus of the course, I've done plenty of visualisations, posters and normal presintations of data, but I've never done audio before. 

after rereading some instructions, I'm going to re-save my XMLs as TXT and try out AntConc again.

I got it to work! screenshot of the namechange will be uploaded

now that I got it to function, some interesting data comes out of that. I can look into phrases too, but it seems to confirm my earlier idea: dispite his famous consern with the slave trade, Livingstone doesn't think about abolition in terms of the rights of the enslaved, or even rights at all.
