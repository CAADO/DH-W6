I'm not quite sure what to put here that didn't go into my podcast or my notes, but I feel good about the decision to change to a podcast, even if it might be a bit lower quality. Based on the course goals, I think challenging myself by moving outside of excel and posters is the correct decision. It challenged me for sure, I don't think I've ever slurred over words as bad as when I'm trying to record. 

Unfortunatly, my external to class situation was poor the whole time across class. Dispite that, I think the class was a good learning experince. 

I don't have anything great to put here, so I thought I would include my script for the podcast (which I abandoned at times) 

[script follows]

“We may compare cannibalism to the stone age, and the times of slavery to the iron and bronze epochs. Slavery is as natural a step in human development as from bronze to iron.” This is a quote from David Livingstone. 

Livingstone is an interesting figure. I think when we look at the public understanding of a figure in today’s world, one of the first places we have to look is Wikipedia. If someone asks the infinite knowledge of the internet “who is this person”, that is the answer they will receive.

“Livingstone's fame as an explorer and his obsession with learning the sources of the Nile River,” wikipedia writes “was founded on the belief that if he could solve that age-old mystery, his fame would give him the influence to end the East African Arab-Swahili slave trade.” 

The end of slavery, then, is central to the public perception of Livingstone. At the same time that he was undertaking his most famous explorations, the united states were fighting a war over slavery. 

There is an important question here, to me. How did Livingstone conceptualise slavery? Why did he desire the end of it? The questions I want to ask here are about ideology, and moral frameworks. Liberal thought, as it was arising around the same time, often framed its abolition in terms of rights. There is both a natural and a civic right to avoid enslavement. 

This analysis allows us to answer this question. Livingstone does not follow this tradition. Rights feature little in Livingstone’s writings, and the rights of slaves, not at all. He rarely talks about slavery in terms of humanity, though he does refer to it as inhumane a pair of times. 

Livingstone, in the total survey of his writing, instead talks about slavery as both a natural thing, and as a negative thing. 

Livingstone, instead, talks about modernity. 

He writes “These were the primitive fauna of Africa, and if vitrified iron from the prodigious number of broken melting furnaces all over the country was known from the remotest times, the Africans seem to have had a start in the race, at a time when our progenitors were grubbing up flints to save a miserable existence by the game they might kill. Slave-trading seems to have been coeval with the knowledge of iron. The monuments of Egypt show that this curse has venerable antiquity” 
If you read Livingstone, you start to see themes of race in his writing. There are firmly different races in the world, and it is up to one race in particular to move out of the dark ages and into modernity. He talks about the interconnectivity between the American slave trade and British industrialisation: 

“We now demand increased supplies of cotton and sugar, and then reprobate the means our American brethren adopt to supply our wants. We claim a right to speak about this evil, and also to act in reference to its removal, the more especially because we are of one blood. It is on the Anglo-American race that the hopes of the world for liberty and progress rest. Now it is very grievous to find one portion of this race practicing the gigantic evil, and the other aiding, by increased demands for the produce of slave labour, in perpetuating the enormous wrong.”

Slavery is not framed for Livingstone in terms of rights, but instead in terms of progress and ancient evil. This progressive modernity exemplifies what was to come in Britain: the racial theory of progress he puts forward here was written more then a decade before Darwin, and two before Galton would write his racist manifesto based upon it. 

Yet still, Livingstone sees culpability in economic participation with slavery. To buy a good made by a slave is to participate in the evil.  

Livingstone is often earnest in his desire to improve the world around him. It is important to understand how the frames that desire imposes on the world can create the justification for a colonial state. Imperialism can have the same progressive and modernist nature as the abolition Livingstone promotes, exactly because he sees progress as the end goal. 

That window into early progressivism helps us understand how men like Livingstone looked at the world

The justifications put forward by Livingstone also, I think help put into deeper contrast the difference between the liberal and the progressive of his day, with progress as a good versus the protection of rights. Men like David Ricardo, a quarter of a century before, advocated for abolition on the grounds of rights. Livingstone desires the same result, but his moral structure and justifications have changed significantly. 

To conduct this research for this podcast, I used AntConc, Voyant and programming setup in this class in the first four weeks.
